# Spikehead Game Engine
## SPIKEHEAD IS NOT DONE
Spikehead is a VERY WIP ECS based game engine using Lua and ImGui(the based stack).

## build instructions 
the build is fully automated but linux only, you just have to do

```chmod +c build.sh``` to make it executable

```./build.sh build <architecture>``` to build or ```./build.sh run <architecture>``` to automatically run too

if you want to erase build files use ```./build.sh clean```

supported achitectures:
* `linux`
* `win32`
